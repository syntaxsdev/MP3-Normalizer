# MP3-Normalizer
For DJ's who download lots of music and cannot afford to sort out duplicates or incorrect titles.

Just set three values in the code.

`$StagingFolder` to the folder with the songs (in MP3 format) that need to be normalized.

`$DuplicateFolder` the folder to store duplicate songs in.

`$CompleteFolder` to the folder to throw the normalized songs in.


#Unbinder.ps1

Unbinds the songs in the folder you specify from the datastore file.
