# MP3-Normalizer
For DJ's who download lots of music and cannot afford to sort out duplicates or incorrect titles.

Just set three values.

`$StagingFolder` to the folder with the songs (in MP3 format) that need to be normalized.
`$DuplicateFolder` the folder to store duplicate songs in.
`$CompleteFolder` folder to throw the normalized songs in.
